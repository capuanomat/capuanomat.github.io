                Explore this website to find out all about me (if you're interested), the work I've done, my research and personal projects, as well as some of the volunteer work I do every holiday!

                If you're here because I redirected you to this page to find my class notes and "Sheets of Knowledge", go straight to the Knowledge Database tab. :)

                Though I hope any interest in me stems from my work or the many positive changes I hope to bring about in the world, it has always seemed to be a point of interest for most people to know find
                out more about the many places I have lived in. So, below is a brief biography detailing the many nations I've been fortunate enough to live in. Why move so much? Mom works for the World Health Organization (WHO), which has an
                internal policies that its directors can't work in any specific office for more than two years. That said, I suspect mom and dad also just enjoy exploring.

                    My birth country. I was born in Chateauroux, Centre Val de Loire, France, but lived in a small town called LeBlanc about an hour away. While moving around different countries that town, and the house my parents own in it, were
                    pretty much the only constant I had growing up. We returned there every summer for Holidays and still do so today. I consider it my hometown.

                Though I hope any interest in me stems from my work or the many positive changes I hope to bring about in the world, it has always seemed to be a point of interest for most people to know find
                out more about the many places I have lived in. So, below is a brief biography detailing the many nations I've been fortunate enough to live in. Why move so much? Mom works for the World Health Organization (WHO), which has an
                internal policies that its directors can't work in any specific office for more than two years. That said, I suspect mom and dad also just enjoy exploring.

                        My birth country. I was born in Chateauroux, Centre Val de Loire, France, but lived in a small town called LeBlanc about an hour away. While moving around different countries that town, and the house my parents own in it, were
                        pretty much the only constant I had growing up. We returned there every summer for Holidays and still do so today. I consider it my hometown.

                        To this, day Vanuatu is the country I've lived the longest in. We moved there at the end of 1995 and remained there for the next 10 years. Vanuatu is an archipelago in Oceania. I lived in Port-Vila, Vanuatu's capital and biggest city,
                        on the island of Efate, which is the second biggest island after Espiritu Santo. My time in Vanuatu was actually the only period during which I went through a Francophone educational syste. I went to l'Ecole Colardo, which is a small
                        school, but I had a few close friends, none of whom I can now find on social media :( I left at the end of sixth grade, this was my first time moving, and the fact that I was moving to an English speaking country was one of the most
                        stressful things I had experienced until that point.
